Data Science Specialization Final Project
=============================================

Introduction
========================================================

The Data Science Specialization Capstone Project from Johns Hopkins University and Coursera is focus in the **Natural Language Processing** domain. The goal of this project is to create an application that predict the next word from a corpus called. For make that prediction Natural Language Processing techniques were used.

Statistical Methods and algorithm
========================================================

The aplication is based on sampled data from diferent source (News, Twitter and Blog), processed appropriately for analysis, and tokenized into n-grams. Using that subset of cleaned data we computed **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** (MLE) of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. We improve accuracy with Jelinek-Mercer smoothing algorithm. 

Shiny App
========================================================

The aplication is a simple user interface that take an text imput and generate a predicted word as output.
